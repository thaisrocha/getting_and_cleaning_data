# getting_and_cleaning_data

The repository contains the code and the documentation used in the Getting and Cleaning Data module.

The script run_analysis.R was developed based on the data set http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data set https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip was unzipped
and the files used on the project course were copied to the working directory /Users/myname, so when you run the script, copy the files to your working directory in RStudio.

The document CodeBook.md decribes the variables used on the script run_analysis.R

The file data_average.txt is the output from step 5.
